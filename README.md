# Note-Taking-Web-Application
Hello There!
I have created a simple note taking web application using MERN with basic login credentials such as Name,email and password. For backend integration I have used MongoDb and nodejs. The following code consists of useful comments that will help the one reading a better understanding.
<npm run> is the command for frontend part to run and <nodemon app.js> is the command for backend part to go up.
